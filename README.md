# adriandersen.github.io

Just a personal startpage, might make it easier for others to customize later, but i'll have to make it work for myself first
## How to use this as your startpage
Most Web browsers allow setting a homepage in the settings. There, you would just insert the URL of your choice, for example
```https://adriandersen.github.io/startpage_2/?darkmode=true&engine=reddit``` or
```https://adriandersen.github.io/startpage_2/?darkmode=false&engine=google```
<br>_Notice the darkmode=true and engine=reddit at the end._

If you want to also set the new-tab page, you might need to download an addon like **'New Tab Redirect' for Chrome** or **'Custom New Tab' for Firefox**
## TODO:

**Will do**
- [X] Set search-engine to url-hash, or default if not defined
- [X] Make one onject per search-engine, to hopefully simplify code and make it easier to add things later
- [ ] Update this readme-file
- [ ] Clean up CSS-file with variables and stuff

**Might do**
- [ ] Add support for "commands" in the input, to do other things than searching

**Want to do**
- [ ] Make everything work?
