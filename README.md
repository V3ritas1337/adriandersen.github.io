# adriandersen.github.io

Just a personal startpage, might make it easier for others to customize later, but i'll have to make it work for myself first


## TODO:

**Will do**
- [ ] Set search-engine to url-hash, or default if not defined
- [ ] Make one onject per search-engine, to hopefully simplify code and make it easier to add things later
- [ ] Update this readme-file
- [ ] Clean up CSS-file with variables and stuff

**Might do**
- [ ] Add support for "commands" in the input, to do other things than searching

**Want to do**
- [ ] Make everything work?
